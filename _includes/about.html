  	<p><strong class="highlight">I am a UI/UX designer</strong>, most of the thigns I make are user oriented. This means that my design process is geared towards a specific client, and a specific purspose. Design for me is first and foremost <strong>functionality</strong> at every level: performtive functionality, code readability, ease of access, and visual simplicity. Design for me is more of an organizational matter, than anything else. I therefore view myself as a specialist in matters of <strong>organization</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, and <strong>taxonomies</strong>. Design is effective information distribution, hence any highly organized and efficient system is always a good designed system, and a beautiful system. Any high order of organization is inherently beatiful, because it lacks unnecessary parts. My life's motto is:<strong class="highlight"> "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem </strong> (entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity)<strong>."</strong></p>
